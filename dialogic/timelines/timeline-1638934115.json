I love red things like apples, strawberries, cotton candy, tomato soup, and also my girlfriend is dressed in red so I guess it applies with people too!\nOh shoot, I think I spent too much time talking to you. OK, see you later! Actually, I hope I don’t! Because a monster might destroy this part of the city!"
